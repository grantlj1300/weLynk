* **Event search and filtering**: Users can browse public and private events and filter active events by category and keyword. The search results are displayed on an interactive map that allows users to view event details and join to gain access to the event page.
* **Event creation and management**: Users can create and post their own events and specify event details (date, time, location, description, etc...).
* **Group chat**: Each event has a dedicated group chat where attendees can communicate and coordinate logistics.
* **User search**: Users can search for other users by username, view their profiles, and connect with them via a friend request.
## Technologies Used

The website uses [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) for event location logic and [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) for the map interface. [Pusher](https://pusher.com) is used for websocket connections to provide real-time data for the groupchats.
